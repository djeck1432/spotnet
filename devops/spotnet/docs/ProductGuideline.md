## **How to Open Position**

1. **Navigate to the Dashboard**  
   Open the platform and go to the **Form** section to start the process.

2. **Deposit Collateral**  
   Select **ETH** as your collateral and deposit it into the **ZkLend** lending protocol.

3. **Choose Leverage Multiplier**  
   Select a leverage multiplier (e.g., 2x, 3x, or 5x). The chosen multiplier will determine how many times you can repeat the process, thereby increasing both your collateral and borrowing capacity.

4. **View Your Position on Dashboard**  
   Once your position is opened, you can monitor it on the **Dashboard** page. Here, you’ll see key metrics like:
   - **Health Factor**: A measure of the safety of your position (higher values are better).
   - **Collateral**: The value of your assets in the position.
   - **Borrowed Amount**: The total amount you have borrowed.
