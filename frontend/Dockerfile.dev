# Stage 1: Build the Vite app
FROM node:20-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and yarn.lock first to leverage Docker's caching
COPY package.json yarn.lock ./

# Install dependencies (including Vite)
RUN yarn install

# Copy the rest of the application files
COPY . .

# Build the Vite app for development (optional: use `dev` for specific dev builds if needed)
RUN yarn build

# Stage 2: Serve the built app using Nginx for development
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built files from the previous stage to the Nginx HTML directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Remove the default Nginx config file and replace it with your custom one
RUN rm /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
COPY spotnet_dev.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/

# Expose port 80 for HTTP traffic
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx in the foreground (daemon off)
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
